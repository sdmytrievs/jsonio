# JSONIO14

## JSONIO library and API for creating structured data exchange interfaces 
(in RAM, via files, and using ArangoDB remote and local instances).

TBD  Why use JSONIO? 

Advantages of the JSONIO JSON parser:

1. Full support of JSON schemas (the same API can be used for schemaless and for schema-related JSON documents).

2. Fixed order of JSON object keys in the document (convenient for rendering in GUIs and comparing dump JSON output).

3. Comprises the basis of JSONUI GUI widgets for editing and viewing schema-related and schemaless JSON documents kept in NoSQL databases such as ArangoDB.
